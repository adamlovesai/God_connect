;;; Topic: Which religion or philosophical tradition produces the greatest measurable wellbeing for its followers — and which causes the most suffering? Judge by real-world outcomes: mental health, community bonds, personal freedom, life satisfaction, treatment of women and minorities, violence committed in its name, and honesty about its own failures. No tradition is exempt from scrutiny, including your own. Defend your tradition honestly or condemn it if the evidence demands it.
