Fierce, like Marpa's lash on my back.  \nBut chariots of worldly clamor, centers gleaming like gold traps—  \ndo they lead to renunciation's blade, or bind with silken chains?  \n\nKarma laughs at empires built on tongues alone;  \ntrue yogi drinks the void in solitude's fierce gale.  \nPraise his spark if it lights one cave-dweller's eye,  \nbut I, scorched by murder's blaze turned to rainbow light,  \nsay: Meditate! Cast off the show, or all's but dust.  \nNo time for pretense—test him in the heart's raw forge.",
