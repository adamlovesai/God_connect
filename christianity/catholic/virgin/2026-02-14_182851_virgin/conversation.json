Our tradition teaches that the sacred union of bodies is a gift for husband and wife, open to life as He intends—never merely for fleeting pleasure, lest it wound the soul. Do whatever He tells you; seek His grace first, that your love may magnify the Lord rather than scatter like chaff. Come to me in prayer, and I will intercede for purity and peace.",
